# ML-Internship-2022
This repository includes Python code of basic concepts and techniques I learned during my two weeks internship at my college in machine learning and deep learning.

The Internship program taught all basic concepts to get started in ML and Deep Learning including expert talks of eminent acadmecians from KIIT University, BITS Pilani and NIT Raipur.

At the end of the program I made some ML projects using ANN and CNN.

## The topics and concepts covered during this program were :-

Introduction to image processing

Basics of python

Package description for ML and Data Science

Data Analytics Techniques, Applications and Use Cases - (Guest Lecture by Dr. Jagannath Singh, Associate Professor, KIIT University

Introduction to Machine Learning

Classification based Learning

“Feature Selection using Genetic Algorithm” - (Guest Lecture by Dr. Lov Kumar, Assistant Professor BITS-PILANI, Hyderabad)

Introduction to Deep Learning

Artificial Neural Networks

Multi-layered Neural Networks

Deep Learning Frameworks and Packages - (Guest Lecture by Dr. Jitendra Kumar Rout, Assistant Professor, NIT Raipur)

Keras API

Deploying AI/ ML products - (Guest Lecture by Er. Ankit Kumar Sinha, Senior Machine Learning Engineer, Teledoc Health, Dallas, Texas, USA)
